Noun Verb Associator WebApplication

Sample/start up code was taken from Prof. Andrew's Assignment 3 for Simplepedia.

This code was produced with the tool create-react-app. This sets up the basic structure for the application and installs some scripts for managing the build.

From within the directory, enter `npm start`. This will start the development server. The development server will automatically compile your code using webpack and serve it.

You should be able to see your application at `localhost:3000` in your web browser. Starting the server will probably open your web browser for you. As an added bonus, the server is setup to "hot load" your code. As you edit your files, when you save, if the server is running, the code will automatically be compiled and the web page refreshed.
